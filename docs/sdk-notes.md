# SDK notes

Other sections are added per spike. Numbers are measured output from the spike scripts, not estimates.

## Moss

- Package: `@moss-js/moss@1.21.0` (pinned with `-E`). ESM only. Native N-API binding comes from the optional dependency `@moss-js/moss-core-darwin-arm64` (0.36.0), so it runs on arm64 with no Rosetta. If you see "Cannot find native binding", check that pnpm installed optional deps.
- Run: `pnpm -r build` first (contracts dist), then `pnpm --filter @ahead/server spike:moss`. The script sets `MOSS_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1`.
- Calls used: `new MossClient(projectId, projectKey)`, `listIndexes()`, `deleteIndex(name)`, `createIndex(name, docs, {modelId: 'moss-minilm'})`, `loadIndex(name)`, `query(name, text, {topK})`, `close()` in `finally`.
- Docs are `{id, text, metadata}`; metadata values must be strings.
- `createIndex` on an existing name throws "Index already exists", so list and delete first.
- `loadIndex` must be called before `query` (no cloud fallback in 1.21.0).

### Measured (10 docs, 20 timed queries)

| Step | Cold (first run) | Warm (second run) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| createIndex (upload + cloud build + poll) | 3820.6 ms | 3326.3 ms |
| loadIndex | 19866.4 ms | 2172.6 ms |
| warmup query | 2.1 ms | 1.9 ms |
| query wall-clock p50 | 2.0 ms | 1.9 ms |
| query wall-clock p95 | 2.4 ms | 2.4 ms |
| SDK `timeTakenInMs` p50 / p95 | 0 / 0 | 0 / 0 |

SDK `timeTakenInMs` is integer ms (sub-ms rounds to 0), so wall-clock around the call is the number to use.

Model cache location: unknown. The 1.21.0 types only expose `cachePath` (optional, for persisting downloaded index data) on the load options, with no documented default. Where the embedding model is stored was not found in the SDK types. The cold-to-warm drop in loadIndex (19.9 s to 2.2 s) suggests something is cached between runs, but the location is not confirmed.

Top hits:
- "draft a message to Priya" -> `evt-priya-q3` (score 0.036)
- "meeting with Priya Thursday" -> `evt-priya-q3` (score 0.351)
- "q3 deck" -> `contact-priya` (score 1.000), not the file doc. The contact doc text says "owns the Q3 deck review", so it matches "q3 deck" about as well as the file doc does; the file doc is not clearly the better semantic match.
- "what time is my Priya meeting" -> `evt-priya-q3` (score 0.353)

### Quirks

- `loadIndex` took about 20 s on this first run. Likely the embedding model downloading from models.moss.link at runtime. Call `loadIndex` at server startup, never on the request path. Re-measure on a warm run.
- Queries are in-process and fast (about 2 ms) once loaded, well under the 10 ms target.
- Scores are not comparable across queries (a 1.000 top score for "q3 deck" still ranked the contact above the file). Do not threshold on raw score without tuning. Short queries like "q3 deck" may favor the contact doc; consider `alpha` tuning or richer doc text in the corpus.
- `timeTakenInMs` is integer-resolution, so measure latency with `performance.now()` around the call.

### Index names (rule)

- The free plan allows 3 indexes total.
- The only allowed index names are `ahead-spike` (spikes) and `ahead-corpus` (Lane B owns it), both exported from `MOSS_INDEX` in `@ahead/contracts`.
- No lane creates any other index.

## Cartesia Sonic (TTS)

**`/tts/bytes` is spike-only. It proves the key and gives a rough time-to-first-byte, but Lane A must use the Sonic WebSocket for real time-to-first-audio.**

- Spike endpoint: `POST https://api.cartesia.ai/tts/bytes` with `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, `Cartesia-Version: 2026-08-14`, `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Model `sonic-3.6`, voice Skylar `db6b0ed5-d5d3-463d-ae85-518a07d3c2b4`, `language: "en"`, output `{container:"wav", encoding:"pcm_s16le", sample_rate:24000}`. Model and voice are constants at the top of `apps/server/scripts/spike-sonic.ts`.
- Run: `pnpm --filter @ahead/server spike:sonic`. Output goes to `var/spikes/sonic.wav` (gitignored).

### Measured (one run, 90-character interjection line)

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| First byte | 547.9 ms |
| Total | 926.6 ms |
| Audio | 5.60 s (268878 bytes, mono 24 kHz s16le) |

`file` reports RIFF WAVE, 16 bit, mono 24000 Hz.

### Quirks

- `voice` as a plain string id worked, no `{id}` wrapper needed.
- Send `language` only, not `locale`.
- The body is a WAV with a 44-byte header, so duration is (bytes - 44) / (24000 * 2).
- Non-2xx: the spike prints `[sonic] error <status> <body>` and exits 1. Never print request headers (they hold the key).
- Valid model ids: `sonic-3.6` (latest), `sonic-3.5`, `sonic-3`.

### WebSocket (what Lane A should use)

- Endpoint: `wss://api.cartesia.ai/tts/websocket?cartesia_version=2026-08-14`.
- Request: `{model_id, transcript, voice, language:"en", context_id, output_format:{container:"raw", encoding:"pcm_s16le", sample_rate}, continue}`.
- Responses: `chunk {data: base64}`, `timestamps`, `flush_done`, `done`, `error`.
- Cancel: `{context_id, cancel:true}` only halts generation that has not started. For barge-in, also drop any incoming chunks for that `context_id` and flush browser playback.
- Use a new `context_id` per reply.
- These WebSocket details come from the docs and are untested live.
